## Supervised Learning
   ### Regression
       Gradient descent: a method to optimize your linear models
       Multiple Linear Regression: a technique for when you are comparing more than two variables
       Polynomial Regression: for relationships between variables that aren't linear
       Regularization: a technique to assure that your models will not only fit to the data available, but also extend to new situations
